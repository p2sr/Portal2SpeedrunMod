# Portal 2 Speedrun Mod
Speedrun Mod for Portal 2. You can call it a family game box for Portal 2 Speedrunning Community. It removes majority of cutscenes and makes the game more entertaining to speedrun. It also introduces several game-changing modes.


## Installation:
0. Note: for now, this mod is for Windows and Linux users only. Sorry, Mac users :/ Also, make sure you have original game (Portal 2, duh) installed on Steam.
1. Download newest release archive from [releases tab](https://github.com/p2sr/Portal2SpeedrunMod/releases). Do **NOT** download the repository: it contains uncompiled version of plugin and resource files, so it most likely won't work (if even launch) properly.
2. Unzip `Portal 2 Speedrun Mod` folder into `sourcemods` directory (its default location is `Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/`).
3. Restart Steam.
4. A new game, called "Portal 2 Speedrun Mod" should appear in your library.

## Currently implemented modes:
### Normal%
- Most of the game's downtime is removed or shortened (like elevators, doors etc.)
- Most of cutscenes were removed or shortened (like Tube Ride, Core etc.)
- A full list of every change can be found [here](https://github.com/p2sr/Portal2SpeedrunMod/blob/master/doc/normalpercentlist.md).

### Fog% (in beta testing)
- Everything from Normal%.
- Dense fog makes you unable to see further than 128 units.
- If you don't move for 20 seconds, you can see through fog until you move again.

### Celeste 2 (in beta testing)
- Everything from Normal%.
- Celeste-like movement added on top of current one (dash, wave dash, wallclimb and many more).
- Container Ride, Portal Carousel, Portal Gun, Smooth Jazz and PotatOS have been modified to fit Celeste movement into the gameplay.

In the final version, these changes will be available:
- Red berries added and placed all around the facility. 
- Quantum berries - special berries that will disappear once you use a portal.
- A special ending course for those who manage to collect all berries.

## Modes planned for the future:
- **100 Portals Run** - complete the game with less than 100 portals.
- **100% Run** - complete the game with all singleplayer achievements.
- **Randomized Map Order** - randomized map order.
- **Fat Run** - complete the game while being 1,875x larger.
- **Potato Challenge** - A copy of SMO's Baloon World.
- **Minecraft%** - You are able to place and break blocks.
- **Tag%** - Complete the game with paintgun instead of portal gun.
- **Mirror%** - Normal game, but mirrored.
- **Bingo** - ???
- **Glitchless** - all glitches patched.
- **Singleplayer co-op** - Co-op but your partner went to the toilet and never came back.
