[![CI](https://github.com/p2sr/Portal2SpeedrunMod/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/p2sr/Portal2SpeedrunMod/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

A mod for speedrunning Portal 2 with minimal downtime and support for alternate gamemodes.

## Installation

0. Note: for now, this mod is for Windows and Linux users only. Sorry, Mac users :/ Also, make sure you have original game (Portal 2, duh) installed on Steam.
1. Download newest release archive from [releases tab](https://github.com/p2sr/Portal2SpeedrunMod/releases). Do **NOT** download the repository: it contains uncompiled version of plugin and resource files, so it most likely won't work (if even launch) properly.
2. Unzip `Portal 2 Speedrun Mod` folder into `sourcemods` directory (its default location is `Steam/steamapps/sourcemods/`).
3. Restart Steam by going to the top left under steam then selecting exit.
4. A new game, called "Portal 2 Speedrun Mod" should appear in your library.
